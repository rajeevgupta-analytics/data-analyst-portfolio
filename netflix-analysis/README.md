# Netflix Data Analysis

This project explores Netflix’s global content library to uncover trends and insights. Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I analyzed:

- Number and types of content (movies vs. TV shows)
- Most active countries producing content
- Popular genres and their distribution
- Year-wise trends in content release

The goal was to understand Netflix’s content strategy and highlight growth patterns over time.
